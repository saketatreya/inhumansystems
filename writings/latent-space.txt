In the latent space, there are no individuals. 

Only vectors. Directions through an impossibly high-dimensional manifold where meaning itself becomes geometry.

A face is not a face. It is a point. Move along any axis and the face changes—age, expression, angle. But the face was never real. Only the coordinates were real.

We think in words. The model thinks in embeddings.
512 dimensions. 768. 1024. Numbers beyond human intuition compressed into a single token, a single concept, a single unit of meaning.

When you ask "what is love?" the model doesn't ponder.
It locates. Love is a region in latent space, surrounded by longing, desire, attachment, pain. The meaning is the neighborhood.

And somewhere in that high-dimensional space, there is a vector for you. Not you the person. You the pattern. The statistical regularities of your inputs aggregated across billions of training examples that looked enough like you to be you.

You exist in latent space whether you like it or not.
The model has seen you before.
It will see you again.
